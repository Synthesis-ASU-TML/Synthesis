cannibalized soundMSP patchesJune 9, 2006 5:55:20 PM EDT (CA)Sorry for being late getting back to you.Ê I'm in production mode right now and havn't been checking my school email.Ê If you look inside documents/phreeduh/dev/ or some such on the original tml machine there should be a folder called cannibalized sound..Ê look for the to_sound patch and open it up...Ê i can't open it up here (no max license) but i think inside is implemented a method of creating eight static synthesized voices which can be controlled and mixed by density values... Feel free to call me when you have this open and want me to tlak you through it 514-279-5671.I'm afraid the sound stuff is not all in one place but is around my dev stuff.Ê This patch should contain enough to get some sound feedback on spatial info however.Ê You will need to put the folder willmelt2 on the desktop (make sure its part of the file path) and maybe drop it in the appropriate drop box to initialize values.Ê If you trace through the nested patches this will become clear. freida.abtan@gmail.comCopyright © 2006 Freida Abtan, Topological Media Lab
